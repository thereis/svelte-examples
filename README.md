In this repository you'll check some examples exploring the features from Svelte.

## Demo

[tightfisted-wheel.surge.sh](https://tightfisted-wheel.surge.sh)

# svelte app

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Deploying to the web

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```
